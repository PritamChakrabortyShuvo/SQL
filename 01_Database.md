# Introduction to Database
A database is an organized collection of data stored and managed so that it can be easily accessed, modified & retrieved when needed. Databases store various types of dataâ€”from customer details in a business to product inventories in a store. We can add new data, update existing information, delete unwanted records & search for specific details using queries. They come in two main types:
1. **SQL Databases :** These use structured tables to organize data, like a spreadsheet with rows and columns (e.g., MySQL, PostgreSQL).
2. **NoSQL Databases :** These use flexible data models, like documents or graphs, which can be more adaptable for unstructured data (e.g., MongoDB, Cassandra).

## Relational Database 
A Relational Database is a type of database. While a database is a general term for any organized collection of data, a relational database specifically uses a structured format, organizing data into tables with rows and columns. This structure is based on the relational model, which allows data in different tables to be linked by relationships, making it ideal for managing data with well-defined connections. In short:
- **Database :** A general data storage system.
- **Relational Database :** A type of database that uses tables and relationships to structure and link data.
